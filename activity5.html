<p id="1st" style="color:red;">Christopher Robert Evans[1] (born June 13, 1981)[2] is an American actor. He first gained attention in 2005 as the Marvel Comics character Human Torch in Fantastic Four (2005) and its 2007 sequel and later gained further worldwide attention for his portrayal of Steve Rogers / Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in eleven films including four cameos. His work in the latter film series established him as one of the highest-paid actors in the world.[3]

Evans began his career on the 2000 television series Opposite Sex. Besides his superhero films, he has appeared in such films as Not Another Teen Movie (2001), Sunshine (2007), Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), Snowpiercer (2013), Gifted (2017), and Knives Out (2019). In 2014, he made his directorial debut with the drama film Before We Go, in which he also starred.[4] In 2018, Evans made his Broadway debut in a production of Lobby Hero. Captain America: The First Avenger is a 2011 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Joe Johnston, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, and Stanley Tucci. Set predominantly during World War II, the film tells the story of Steve Rogers, a sickly man from Brooklyn who is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red Skull, who intends to use an artifact called the "Tesseract" as an energy-source for world domination.

The film began as a concept in 1997 and was scheduled for distribution by Artisan Entertainment. However, a lawsuit not settled until September 2003 disrupted the project. In 2005, Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount Pictures. Directors Jon Favreau and Louis Leterrier were interested in directing the project before Johnston was approached in 2008. The principal characters were cast between March and June 2010. Production began in June 2010, and filming took place in London, Manchester, Caerwent, Liverpool, and Los Angeles.

Captain America: The First Avenger premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on July 19, 2011, and was released in the United States on July 22, 2011. The film was commercially successful, grossing over $370 million worldwide. Critics particularly praised Evans' performance, the film's depiction of its 1940s time period, and Johnston's direction. Two sequels titled Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War were released in 2014 and 2016 respectively. </ br></ br>

<p id="2nd" style="color:black;">Evans was born on June 13, 1981, in Boston, Massachusetts,[5] and grew up in the nearby town of Sudbury.[6] His mother, Lisa (née Capuano), is an artistic director at the Concord Youth Theater,[7][8] and his father, G. Robert Evans III, is a dentist.[9] His mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent, while his father is of half British and half German ancestry.[10][11][12] Evans's parents divorced in 1999.[13]

He has an older sister named Carly, a younger brother named Scott, and a younger sister named Shanna.[9][14] Carly is a graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and a high school drama and English teacher at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School,[7][15] while Scott is an actor who was featured on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live. He and his siblings were raised Catholic.[11][12] Their uncle, Mike Capuano, represented the same Massachusetts Congressional district formerly represented by Tip O'Neill.[10] He also has three younger half-siblings from his father's second marriage.[16]

Evans graduated from Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School.[6] He moved to New York City and took classes at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.In the present day, scientists in the Arctic uncover an old, frozen aircraft. In March 1942, Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and his men steal a mysterious relic called the Tesseract,[N 2] which possesses untold powers, from the town of Tønsberg in German-occupied Norway.

In New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment because of various health and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend, Sgt. James "Bucky" Barnes, Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a "super-soldier" experiment under Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips, and British agent Peggy Carter. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects.

Schmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt discovers Erskine's location and dispatches assassin Heinz Kruger to kill him. Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with "vita-rays". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule. With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as "Captain America" to promote war bonds while scientists study him and attempt to reverse-engineer the formula. In 1943, while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes' unit was MIA in a battle against Schmidt's forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer Howard Stark fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's Nazi division Hydra, freeing Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that earned him the sobriquet "the Red Skull". Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers.

Rogers recruits Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier to attack other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations. In 1945, the team assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his apparent death.[N 3] Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, which opens a wormhole into space, sucking him into it. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.

Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Hearing a radio broadcast of a baseball game that he attended in 1941, Rogers deduces that something is wrong. He flees outside and finds himself in present-day Times Square, where S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury informs him that he has been "asleep" for nearly 70 years. In a post-credits scene, Fury approaches Rogers and proposes a mission with worldwide ramifications.[N 4] [17]</ br></ br></ br></ br> </p>
<p id="3rd" style="color:green;">Evans's first credited appearance was in a short educational video titled Biodiversity: Wild About Life! in 1997.[18] In 1999, Evans was the model for "Tyler" in Hasbro's board game Mystery Date. The special edition of the game included an electronic phone, which Evans is shown speaking into on the game box.[19]

After filming wrapped on Not Another Teen Movie,[20] Evans landed lead roles in The Perfect Score and Cellular, and then starred in two independent films in Chicago: Dirk Wittenborn's Fierce People, playing the sinister Bryce, and London, playing a drug user Syd with relationship problems.[21] He then played the superhero Johnny Storm, the Human Torch in the 2005 comic book adaptation Fantastic Four.

In 2008, Evans appeared as Detective Paul Diskant in Street Kings, co-starring Keanu Reeves, and the Tennessee Williams screenplay adaptation The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond, co-starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Ellen Burstyn. The following year he appeared in the science-fiction thriller Push, with Dakota Fanning and Camilla Belle. Evans performed his own fight scenes, which took weeks to film, and was bruised during filming.[24] In 2010, he completed filming on co-directors Mark Kassen and Adam Kassen's Puncture in Houston, Texas. The film was selected to debut at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival as one of the Spotlight projects for the 10th anniversary of the festival.[25] Also that year, Evans appeared in Sylvain White's The Losers, an adaptation of the comic-book series from the DC Comics imprint Vertigo.[26] Evans then appeared in another comic-book adaptation, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, where he portrayed Lucas Lee, one of Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes.[27]

In 2011, Evans played the Marvel Comics character Captain America in Captain America: The First Avenger, and starred in the film What's Your Number?, a romantic comedy co-starring Anna Faris.[28][29] There were initially scheduling conflicts, as both films were set to film in mid-2010.[30] Evans had signed on to appear in multiple films as Captain America, and first reprised the role in the 2012 film The Avengers.[28] He next starred opposite Michael Shannon in The Iceman, replacing James Franco, who had dropped out.[31] Evans wore a long wig and grew out a beard for the role.[32] He starred in South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's English-language film Snowpiercer.[33]

In 2014, Evans starred in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[34] He starred opposite Michelle Monaghan in the romantic comedy Playing It Cool.[35] His directorial debut, Before We Go,[36] debuted at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.[4] In 2015, he played Captain America again in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and reprised the role in the 2016 sequel Captain America: Civil War,[37][38] as well as in 2018's Avengers: Infinity War, and its 2019 sequel, Avengers: Endgame.[39]

Evans said in March 2014 that once his contract with Marvel is up, he might consider doing less acting so he could work more on directing.[40][36] In September 2015, he said he would be willing to sign on for more films as Captain America after Infinity War if Marvel wanted to extend his contract.[41] However, he has since stated that he would retire from portraying the role after Avengers: Endgame.[42]

<p id="4th" style="color:orange;">Evans starred in the family drama Gifted in 2017. He made his Broadway debut in Lobby Hero, directed by Trip Cullman, which opened in March 2018 at the Helen Hayes Theatre as a part of Second Stage Theatre's first Broadway season.[43][44]

In 2019, Evans portrayed the lead role of an Israeli Mossad agent in the Netflix thriller The Red Sea Diving Resort.[45] Later in the year, he starred in the murder mystery film Knives Out, which was released in November 2019 to positive reviews from film critics.[46][47] In addition, he is set to produce and star in the Defending Jacob series    Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:
    A frail, sickly young man who is enhanced to the peak of human ability by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States war effort.[11] Evans, who previously worked with Marvel as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four film series, said he declined the part three times before signing a six-picture deal with Marvel, explaining that, "At the time, I remember telling a buddy of mine, 'If the movie bombs, I'm f—-ed [sic]. If the movie hits, I'm f—-ed!' I was just scared. I realized my whole decision-making process was fear-based, and you never want to make a decision out of fear. I can't believe I was almost too chicken to play Captain America."[12] Evans ultimately agreed to the role, saying, "I think Marvel is doing a lot of good things right now, and it's a fun character. ... I think the story of Steve Rogers is great. He's a great guy. Even if it [were] just a script about anybody, I would probably want to do it. So it wasn't necessarily about the comic itself."[13] Regarding the extent of the character's abilities Evans remarked, "He would crush the Olympics. Any Olympic sport he's gonna dominate. He can jump higher, run faster, lift stronger weight, but he can be injured. He could roll an ankle and be out for the season. He's not perfect, he's not untouchable. So a lot of the effects, if I'm going to punch someone they're not going to put them on a cable and fly them back 50 feet, but he's going to go down, probably not getting back up, which I think humanizes it. It makes it something that, again, I think everyone can relate to a little bit more, which I really like."[14] Theater actor Leander Deeny was the body double in some shots for Steve Rogers' pre-transformation physique as well as appearing as a bartender.[15][16]
    Tommy Lee Jones as Chester Phillips:
    A colonel in the United States Army and member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve who heads the project to create super soldiers. The character was updated from the comics, where Phillips was the one to recruit Rogers to join Project Rebirth that made him Captain America.[17] Jones described the character as "the one you've seen in a thousand movies: the gruff, skeptical officer overseeing a team of talented, slightly sarcastic, specially talented soldiers".[18]
    Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt / Red Skull:
    Adolf Hitler's head of advanced weaponry and commander of the terrorist organization Hydra whose own plan for world domination involves harnessing the power of the magical object known as the Tesseract.[12][19][20][21] Weaving stated that he patterned Red Skull's accent on those of Werner Herzog and Klaus Maria Brandauer.[22] About the character, Weaving remarked, "I think the major difference between Skull and Cap, they've both had the serum, and the serum seems to augment certain qualities that each of them have. Cap is much more in tune with other people I think. Schmidt is in tune with himself, and his own needs, and his own ego, so I suppose it augments that. From that point of view, they're quite opposite."[23]
    Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter:
    An officer with the Strategic Scientific Reserve who works with Phillips on the super soldier project. Regarding her preparation for the role, she said, "I'm training at the moment six days a week to make her a bit more military and make it convincing that I could kick butt."[24] About the character, Atwell stated, "I likened her character to that famous Ginger Rogers quote. She can do everything Captain America can do, but backwards and in high heels. She's an English soldier through and through, although she always looks fabulous. She might stand there with a machine-gun shooting Nazis, but she's obviously gone to the loo beforehand and applied a bit of lipstick. She doesn't need to be rescued. That's exciting to me – her strength."[25] She added, "I think she's quite stubborn, a slightly frustrated woman who struggles with being a woman in that time. But more importantly she's a modern woman and she sees something in Captain America that she relates to, and becomes kindred spirits. He treats her very differently to how she's been treated by lots of men, in this kind of dominated world she lives in. So she's very much a fighter."[26]
    Sebastian Stan as James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes:
    A sergeant in the United States Army, Rogers' best friend, and member of his squad of commandos. Stan has signed on for "five or six pictures".[27] He revealed that he did not know anything about the comic books, but watched a lot of documentaries and films about World War II in preparation for the role, calling Band of Brothers "very helpful". About the role, Stan stated, "Steve Rogers and Bucky are both orphans and kind of like brothers. They kind of grow up together and look after each other. It's a very human, relatable thing... I also wanted to look out for how their relationship changes once Steve Rogers becomes Captain America. There's always a competition and they're always one-upping each other. I paid attention to how Bucky is affected by Steve's change and suddenly Steve is this leader".[28]
    Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark:
    The father of Tony Stark who worked on various government projects dating back to the World War II era.[29][30] About the role, Cooper stated, "It's an opportunity where you can see his future because I know the guy who becomes my son and I see myself as an older version in Iron Man 2 which is great for an actor to have those tools. All I know of him is that he's a fantastic engineer and inventor and a very slick Howard Hughes type that's into aviation and women!"[31]
    Neal McDonough as Timothy "Dum Dum" Dugan:
    A member of Rogers' squad of commandos. McDonough wore the character's signature bowler hat and said he grew Dugan's trademark mustache. About his role in the film he remarked, "Oh, I'm going to see a lot of action. [I'm] the go-to guy, so I'm very happy with that."[32]
    Derek Luke as Gabe Jones:
    A member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Luke said he was cast without a script or much of a description of the character. As to why he took the part, "I just believed that Marvel was doing some really great work, great messages in films. The good versus evil and I was just like, 'How can I be down?'"[33]
    Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine:
    The scientist who created the Super Soldier Serum.[34] Tucci said that what drew him to the role was the opportunity to do a German accent, which was something he always wanted to try.[35]

Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury, the director of the super-spy agency, S.H.I.E.L.D.[36] Kenneth Choi appears as Jim Morita, a Japanese-American member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan. About his preparation for the role, Choi said, "[I] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the 'Nisei' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII. I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances."[37] Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier, a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk.[38] JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery Falsworth, a British member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Feild called his part in the film "a very physical job. I play one of the Captain's sidekicks so I've been running around shooting things and blowing things up and trying to look cool for about a year."[39] Additionally, Toby Jones was cast as Arnim Zola, a biochemist for the Nazi party,[40] Richard Armitage portrays Heinz Kruger, the Red Skull's top assassin,[41] Lex Shrapnel portrays Gilmore Hodge, a candidate for the super soldier program,[42] Michael Brandon portrays Brandt, a United States Senator who recognizes the PR potential of Captain America.[43] Jeff Goldblum had originally been approached to play the part; he later played Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok.[44] Natalie Dormer portrays Lorraine, a private who attempts to seduce Rogers,[45] and Jenna Coleman appears as Connie, Bucky's date at the World Expo.[46] Laura Haddock, who would go on to portray Meredith Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy, has a brief appearance as an autograph seeker. Writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy James Gunn jokingly claimed that this was Peter Quill's grandmother.[47] Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as a general.[48] </ br></ br></ br></ br>

Evans is a fan of the New England Patriots and narrated America's Game: The Story of the 2014 New England Patriots[50] and America's Game: 2016 Patriots.[51]

While filming Gifted in 2015, Evans adopted a dog named Dodger from a local animal shelter at which part of the film was shot.[52] In 2017, Evans was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.In 2012, Evans affirmed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "It's insane that civil rights are being denied people in this day and age. It's embarrassing, and it's heartbreaking. It goes without saying that I'm completely in support of gay marriage. In ten years we'll be ashamed that this was an issue."[54] In August 2016, Evans supported Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's continued enforcement of the state's ban on assault weapons.[55]

Evans endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[56] He has also been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.[57][13]

In April 2019, Evans launched a website called A Starting Point, which is intended to "'demystify politics' by directly showcasing both Democratic and Republican lawmakers succinctly giving their position on 'dozens' of different political issues."[58][59] After Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act in May 2019, which imposes a near-total ban on abortions in the state, Evans wrote on Twitter that the bill was "absolutely unbelievable" and continued by saying, "If you're not worried about Roe v. Wade, you're not paying attention."[60]
I am single and not looking to be in a relationship.
But my happiness in this world - my level of peace - is never going to be dictated by acting.
For the youth, the indignation of most things will just surge as each birthday passes.</ br></ br>
